# Instant Framed Camera
The code used for both the camera and the frame in my 'Instant Framed Camera' project.
[More on this project here!](https://maxvanleeuwen.com/project/instant-framed-camera/)
The scripts auto-start using a cron job, and [some fast-bootup tricks were applied](http://himeshp.blogspot.com/2018/08/fast-boot-with-raspberry-pi.html).

# Hardware used

Camera

- [Li-ion Battery HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/li-ion-battery-hat.htm)
